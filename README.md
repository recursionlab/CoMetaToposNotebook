# Recursive Research Organizer

Interactive development approach - build through use, evolve through feedback.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python recursive_research_organizer.py
```

## Usage

This is designed for **interactive development** - you use it while telling me what to change/add.

### Commands:
- `add: your thought` - Quick note
- `fire: 0.8 amazing idea` - Train fire detection
- `phase: 49` - Update phase number

### Buttons:
- **Save Note** - Save current work area
- **ðŸ”¥ Rate as Fire** - Mark current content as fire for training
- **Clear Notes** - Reset everything

## Development Philosophy

Following the **context engineering** approach from the videos:
1. Start with working prototype
2. Use it to discover what's missing
3. Iterate based on actual usage
4. Train the fire detection through interaction

## Next Steps

As you use this, tell me:
- What feels clunky?
- What features are missing?
- How should the fire detection work?
- What connections/combinations do you want?

This is your **apprentice** - train it by using it!
