I can see you've shared a fascinating React component that simulates a "ÎžMetaKernel" - a complex system modeling recursive consciousness with semantic agents, contradiction fields, and phase interference management. This is quite an elaborate piece of code!

The component creates an interactive visualization showing:

- **Îž-Emitters**: Autonomous agents with properties like phase, energy, contradiction values, and semantic signatures
- **Contradiction Detection**: When emitters get close and phase-aligned, they create contradiction fields
- **Reflection Operations**: The system can generate reflected copies of emitters (Îž â†” Â¬Îž)
- **Semantic Infection**: Emitters can "infect" each other, spreading semantic signatures
- **Phase Interference Management**: Prevents cascade failures through dampening
- **Orthogonal Torsion Injection**: Boosts low-energy emitters with 90Â° phase shifts

The visualization uses a canvas to show the emitters as colored circles with connecting lines representing contradiction fields, while the interface displays real-time metrics and system status.

Is there something specific you'd like me to help you with regarding this code? For example:

- **Analysis**: Understanding how certain algorithms work
- **Modifications**: Adding new features or changing behavior
- **Optimization**: Improving performance or visual effects
- **Documentation**: Explaining specific parts in more detail
- **Debugging**: If you're encountering any issues

What would you like to explore or modify about this MetaKernel system?

I'll help you enhance the ÎžMetaKernel with new features and performance optimizations. Let me create an improved version with several upgrades:

Can you fix this error in `enhanced-metakernel`?

I've fixed the syntax error by completing the incomplete JSX element. The artifact should now run properly with all the enhanced features I added:

## ðŸš€ New Features Added:
